//////Hangman////

//The user must be able to play against the computer

//The word that the computer chooses must be random. There is a large array of words below.

//The user must have a limited number of guesses

//After each guess, the computer should print out the current state of the word you are guessing. (ex. A _ _ L E, for apple)

//After each guess the computer should print out how many guesses you have remaining. For full credit, make it actually print out a picture somewhat similar to the link above.

//The computer should tell the user if she wins, show her how many guesses it took and end the current game

//The user should see the correct answer if she loses

//The user should have the option to play the game again.


//PART ONE//


print("Enter name:")
let userName = readLine()!

print("Welcome \(userName)! Lets play hangman!")


//Part 1-A

//print("Hangman imaage- plank")

//print("guess your first letter")
//let firstLetter = readLine()
//unwrap
// return value pass or no
//continue -- back to word banks
